# README: C++ Module 04 Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the C++ Module 04 project at Code 42 school! This project delves into the fascinating world of subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++. Through practical exercises and code implementation, you'll explore these essential concepts and solidify your understanding.

## Subject Overview
The project encompasses several exercises, each designed to reinforce specific aspects of subtype polymorphism, memory management, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++. Here's a brief overview of each exercise:

### Exercise 00: Polymorphism
Exercise 00 introduces you to the concept of polymorphism. You'll create base and derived classes such as `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`, where each derived class overrides member functions to exhibit specific behaviors. This exercise lays the foundation for understanding inheritance and dynamic polymorphism.

### Exercise 01: Memory Management
Building on polymorphism, Exercise 01 focuses on memory management. You'll implement a `Brain` class and manage dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in derived classes like `Dog` and `Cat`. Deep copying and memory management are the key highlights of this exercise.

### Exercise 02: Abstract Classes
Exercise 02 delves into abstract classes. The default `Animal` class is made abstract to prevent direct instantiation, emphasizing the concept of abstraction. You'll learn how to design abstract classes and ensure that only derived classes like `Dog` and `Cat` can be instantiated.

### Exercise 03: Interfaces
In Exercise 03, you'll dive into interfaces using pure abstract classes. Implementing interfaces for various classes like `AMateria`, `ICharacter`, and `IMateriaSource`, you'll explore polymorphic behavior and dynamic dispatch. This exercise emphasizes interface design and its role in achieving polymorphism.
