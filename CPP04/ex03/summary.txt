This was the summary of the subject and my resolution for a programming project at Code 42 school. Please create a README for this project on GitHub. Explain in DETAIL the subject and my code.
These are the functions I created for this project.
int	main(void)
void	clearScreen( void )
void	limitsTest( void )
void	pressEnter( void )
void	printBanner( const std::string &msg )
void	subjectTest( void )

Explain everything in DETAIL, the subject, building, running, testing, and explain each function in the order they are called in the code.
