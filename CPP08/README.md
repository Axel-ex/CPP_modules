# CPP08

This project aimed to explore the Standard Template Library (STL) and get acquainted with the containers and algorithms it offers. More info about subject requirements here: [subject](en.subject.pdf).

### Exercise00: Easyfind
This exercise involves implementing a function template `easyfind` that searches for a given number in a container of integers. It throws an exception if the number is not found.

### Exercise01: Span
This exercise focuses on developing a `Span` class capable of storing a maximum of N integers. It provides methods to add numbers, calculate the shortest and longest spans, and fill the container using iterators.

### Exercise02: MutantStack
In this exercise, a `MutantStack` class is implemented, which extends the functionality of the `std::stack` container by making it iterable. It offers iterators in addition to its member functions.
