# Exercice01: Span

The Span class is designed to store a maximum of N integers, where N is an unsigned int variable passed to the constructor. It provides functionality to add numbers, calculate the shortest and longest spans, and fill the container with a range of iterators.

## Implementation Details

The Span class includes the following functionalities:

- **addNumber**: Adds a single number to the Span. Throws an exception if the maximum capacity is reached.
- **shortestSpan**: Finds the shortest span (or distance) between all the numbers stored in the Span.
- **longestSpan**: Finds the longest span (or distance) between all the numbers stored in the Span.
- **fill**: Fills the Span container with a range of iterators, allowing the addition of many numbers in one call.
- **Getter and Setter methods**: Get and set methods to access and modify the maximum capacity and elements of the Span.
