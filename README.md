# C++ Modules Overview

This repository contains the C++ modules implemented during the common core of 42 school. Each module covers various topics and exercises designed to enhance our understanding of C++ programming concepts.

Below is a summary of each module along with links to their respective README files:

| Module | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [CPP00](./CPP00/README.md) | Introduction to the basics of C++ including namespaces, class, member functions, access specifiers, and more. |
| [CPP01](./CPP01/README.md) | Introduction to memory allocation, pointers, references, switch statements, and basic string manipulation. |
| [CPP02](./CPP02/README.md) | Focuses on ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form. |read
| [CPP03](./CPP03/README.md) | Covers inheritance, virtual functions, polymorphism, and abstract classes. |
| [CPP04](./CPP04/README.md) | subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.. |
| [CPP05](./CPP05/README.md) | Explores advanced topics subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.such as nested classes, function pointers, and pointers to members. |
| [CPP06](./CPP06/README.md) | Type casts in C++ |
| [CPP07](./CPP07/README.md) | Introduction to compile time polymorphism in C++ with templates. |
