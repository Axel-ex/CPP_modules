# C++ Modules Overview

This repository contains the C++ modules implemented during the common core of 42 school. Each module covers various topics and exercises designed to enhance our understanding of C++ programming concepts.

Below is a summary of each module along with links to their respective repositories:

| Module | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [CPP00](https://github.com/Axel-ex/CPP_modules/tree/main/CPP00) | Basics of C++: namespaces, class, member functions, access specifiers, and more. |
| [CPP01](https://github.com/Axel-ex/CPP_modules/tree/main/CPP01) | Memory allocation, pointers, references, switch statements, and basic string manipulation. |
| [CPP02](https://github.com/Axel-ex/CPP_modules/tree/main/CPP02) | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form. |
| [CPP03](https://github.com/Axel-ex/CPP_modules/tree/main/CPP03) |Inheritance, and virtual inheritance.  |
| [CPP04](https://github.com/Axel-ex/CPP_modules/tree/main/CPP04) | Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. |
| [CPP05](https://github.com/Axel-ex/CPP_modules/tree/main/CPP05) | Exception, pointers to member function and more. |
| [CPP06](https://github.com/Axel-ex/CPP_modules/tree/main/CPP06) | Type casts. |
