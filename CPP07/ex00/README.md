# Exercise00: Function Templates

This exercise involves implementing three function templates: `swap`, `min`, and `max`. These templates are designed to work with any type of argument, as long as the two arguments passed to them have the same type and support all the necessary comparison operators.

### `swap`
The `swap` function template swaps the values of two given arguments. It does not return anything.

### `min`
The `min` function template compares the two values passed in its arguments and returns the smallest one. If the two values are equal, it returns the second one.

### `max`
The `max` function template compares the two values passed in its arguments and returns the greatest one. If the two values are equal, it returns the second one.
