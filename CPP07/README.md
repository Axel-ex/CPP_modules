# CPP07

This project aimed to explore how generic programming works / how compile time polymorphism is achieved in C++ using templates. More info about subject requirements here: [subject](en.subject.pdf).

### Exercise00: Functions template
This exercise involves implementing functions template `swap`, `max` and `min`.

### Exercise01: Iter
This exercise involves implementing a function template `iter` that takes three parameters: the address of an array, the length of the array, and a function to be called on each element of the array.

### Exercise02: Array
This exercise focuses on developing a class template `Array` that contains elements of type T. It implements construction with no parameters, construction with a specified number of elements, construction by copy, assignment operator, subscript operator, a size() member function, and handling out-of-bounds index accesses with exceptions.
