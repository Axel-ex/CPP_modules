# CPP02

This module aims to explore the concepts of Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form through a series of exercises. See [subject](en.subject.pdf).

### Exercise00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
Exercise 00 introduces the Orthodox Canonical class form by implementing a class to represent fixed-point numbers. It covers the basics of class construction, destruction, and raw bit access.

### Exercise01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
Exercise 01 extends the Fixed Point Number class to handle integer and floating-point inputs. It introduces constructors for initialization and member functions for value conversion and output stream insertion.

### Exercise02: Now weâ€™re talking
Exercise 02 enhances the Fixed Point Number class with operator overloading for comparison, arithmetic, and increment/decrement operations. Static member functions are added for computing minimum and maximum values between fixed-point numbers.

### Exercise03: BSP
Exercise03 implements a function to determine whether a given point lies inside a triangle or not. It includes the implementation of a `Point` class in Orthodox Canonical Form to represent 2D points using The `Fixed` class implemented in the previous exercises.
