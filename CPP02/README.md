# CPP02: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form

This module aims to explore the concepts of Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form through a series of exercises.

## Exercise00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
Exercise 00 introduces the Orthodox Canonical class form by implementing a class to represent fixed-point numbers. It covers the basics of class construction, destruction, and raw bit access.

## Exercise01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
Exercise 01 extends the Fixed Point Number class to handle integer and floating-point inputs. It introduces constructors for initialization and member functions for value conversion and output stream insertion.

## Exercise02: Now weâ€™re talking
Exercise 02 enhances the Fixed Point Number class with operator overloading for comparison, arithmetic, and increment/decrement operations. Static member functions are added for computing minimum and maximum values between fixed-point numbers.
